===============================================================================
Advanced Phase 12 - Customer Report View
===============================================================================

Purpose:
Create a customer-level reporting view that consolidates transactional data,
customer details, and business KPIs into a single, queryable structure.

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields: names, ages, transaction data
2. Segment customers by:
   - Lifetime behavior (VIP, Regular, New)
   - Age brackets (Under 20, 20â€“29, etc.)
3. Aggregates:
   - Total orders
   - Total sales
   - Total quantity purchased
   - Unique products
   - Lifespan (months)
4. Calculates KPIs:
   - Recency (months since last order)
   - Average order value (AOV)
   - Average monthly spend

SQL Functions Used:
- COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), DATEDIFF(), CASE WHEN
- CTEs (modular logic)
- CREATE VIEW for reusability
